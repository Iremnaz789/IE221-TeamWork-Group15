# IE221 – Team Work 3  
## Experimental Verification of SLLN and CLT

This project experimentally verifies the **Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN)** and the  
**Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** using simulation methods.  
In addition, a Monte Carlo method is used to estimate the value of π, demonstrating a practical application of SLLN.

All simulations in this project are implemented using **MATLAB**.
